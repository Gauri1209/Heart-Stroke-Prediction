# Heart-Stroke-Prediction
Prediction of heart stroke using ML techniques

This project predicts the possibility of the heart stroke chances for any individual. 
It is based on Machine learning. 
I have used Kaggle's Cardiovascular Disease dataset https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset
All the necessary data preprocessing is done and I applied 8 Machine Learning algorithms on it to check the accuracy.
Algorithms applied were- KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Network, XGBoost, Artificial Neural Network(ANN).
I got high accuracy from Random Forest so finally the dataset was trained by it.
Then by using Flask I deployed the model.
